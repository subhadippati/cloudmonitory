Cloud Monitoring Dashboard  

This project is a Cloud Monitoring Dashboard that dynamically displays real-time metrics such as CPU, memory, and storage usage. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a beautiful, responsive UI with random data simulation for visualization. Additionally, it provides a comparison of two cloud providers, enhancing user insights.  

For deployment, the project is hosted on AWS S3 using free static website hosting. To set up, simply create an **S3 bucket**, enable static website hosting, upload project files, and configure public access permissions. Once deployed, the dashboard can be accessed through the **S3 Endpoint URL**, making it a simple yet effective cloud monitoring solution.
